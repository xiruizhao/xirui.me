<p>2020-09-20
According to utilitarianism, satisfaction of desires (utility) is the fundamental moral good and the morally right action is that which maximizes the social utility (sum of everyone’s utility).</p>
<p>Utilitarianism sounds about right. For one individual, the rational course of action is to manage his gains and losses to achieve the maximal utility over his lifetime. Consequently, for a group of individuals, the rational course of action must be to allocate each individual’s gains and losses to achieve the maximal social utility. Utilitarians say that basic rights and liberties are protected because they are necessary to achieve the maximal social utility.</p>
<p>To understand social utility, utilitarians introduce an impartial spectator, through whom the the desires of many are translated and adjusted into the vicarious desires of one and through whom the principle of rational choice extends to the society. But it is not rational for one person to bear the cost of another person’s pleasure, because he does not and there is nothing. will not</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The Chamberlain argument against redistribution (WIP)</h3>
<p>2021-01-31</p>
<p>Distributive justice concerns the moral principles underlying just (re)distribution of resources, wealth, income, etc. Nozick finds this term prejudicial, since there is no central agency distributing <em>all</em> the resources (assuming that you do not live in Maoist China). Nozick prefers the neutral term “justice in holdings”.</p>
<p>Nozick’s theory of justice in holdings is called the “entitlement theory”. Basically, some specific kinds of actions entitle you to some property. It has three subject matters: 1) justice in acquisition (how people come to appropriate unowned objects), 2) justice in transfer and 3) rectification of injustice for violations of 1) and 2). Nozick only sketches the outlines of each subject. With regard to justice in acquisition, he rejects Locke’s labor-mixing theory (a person comes to appropriate an unowned object by “mixing” his labor with it) or the added value theory; however, he thinks it should contain at least a weak version of the Lockean proviso “enough and as good left over” that appropriation cannot disable another person from “[using] freely what he previously could”. With regard to rectification, he referred readers to Boris Bittker’s 1973 book <em>The Case for Black Reparations</em>, in which Bittker argues for, among others, compensation for school segregation.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the entitlement theory’s details can be spelled out through theoretical investigation.</p>
<p>The entitlement theory is historical: it looks at the causal history of the current distribution (who has what) to determine whether it is just; in contrast, end-state principles look at only the structural properties of the current time-slice (or a function of current and past time-slices). For example, a classical utilitarian looks only at the total utility (perhaps over one’s lifetime), a sufficientarian whether everyone’s welfare meets a threshold. The entitlement theory should be contrasted with another class of principles of distributive justice: patterned principles. Patterned principles specify that a person’s holdings should be proportional to a function of some “natural”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> dimension(s), e.g., moral merit, contribution to society, (for a socialist) adjusted labor hours, IQ, educational attainment, past victimization<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The entitlement theory is not patterned because it simply does not say that holdings should vary with some natural dimension, although the actual distribution guided by the entitlement theory may <em>coincidentally</em> vary with one because independent individuals may perform actions that in aggregate produce such patterning, e.g., marginal product in a free market. The entitlement theory says that no pattern is built into the concept of justice.</p>
<p>The Chamberlain argument against patterned (and end-state) principles of distributive justice goes as follows. Assume that your favorite patterned principle <em>P</em> is realized; everyone has exactly what he deserves (call this distribution <em>D1</em>). Suppose that Wilt Chamberlain is a very popular basketball player and charges 25 cents per ticket. Suppose that in one season, one million people attended his game and he gained $250,000 (call the new distribution <em>D2</em>). Is <em>D2</em> unjust? If it is, it seems that every ordinary transaction may disturb a just distribution and requires redistribution. Nozick therefore says, “patterning requires continuous interference with individuals’ actions and choices”.</p>
<p>The quote above lends to an impression that individual liberties should be counterbalanced with patterning concerns, that Nozick’s argument boils down to an imperious insistence that liberty matters more than patterns (e.g., equality). But Mark (2018) presetns a better interpretation: the Chamberlain argument points out <em>internal</em> contradictions in patterned princples. We assumed that <em>D1</em> is just (in accordance with <em>P</em>), so how did disparate individuals’ voluntary choices contaminate the distribution and introduce injustice? If <em>P</em> commands the transfer of a portion of Chamberlain’s money to the attendants, that would seem odd because we assumed that the attendants voluntarily chose to pay Chamberlain; if <em>P</em> commands the transfer to third parties, that would seem equally odd because while the coins were in the attendants’ pockets, third parties had no claim over them, but somehow attendants’ voluntary transactions with Chamberlain, not unjustly worsening third parties’ situation, give rise to a claim in the proceeds. Patterned principles owe us an explanation of why it is just to incessantly and forcefully counteract and reverse the effects of individuals’ free use of their property, negating their exact intentions of the transactions.</p>
<p>Even if the Chamberlain argument does not convert you to libertarianism, hopefully it does convince you that redistribution for its own sake is morally impermissible. Valid “redistribution” must take the form of compensation for actual injuries (i.e., rectification).</p>
